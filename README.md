# QEDispInv: Surface Wave Dispersion Curve Computation and Inversion Toolkit

## Overview

QEDispInv is an open-source C++ program developed for the forward modeling and inversion of surface wave dispersion curves,
accompanying this work on integrating quadratic extrema interpolation and randomized layering with multiple initial models.
This toolkit encompasses the complete workflow of surface wave analysis, from dispersion curve calculation to subsurface
structure inversion, designed to address the challenges of low-velocity layers (LVLs) and ``mode-kissing'' phenomena in
complex geological models.

## Key Features

- **Forward Modeling**: Implements the quadratic extrema interpolation method for accurate and efficient dispersion curve computation, specifically optimized to resolve mode-kissing zones in models with LVLs. This method significantly reduces root omission rates compared to conventional approaches (e.g., CPS) while achieving substantial speed improvements ($12.6\times$ for full-mode computation and $17.4\times$ for fundamental-mode calculation in benchmark tests).
- **Inversion Framework**: Incorporates wavelength-constrained layering schemes that adapt to the depth-dependent resolution of surface wave data, combined with depth-zoned empirical relationships for deriving P-wave velocity and density from shear-wave velocity. The inversion process utilizes the L-BFGS-B algorithm, with statistical aggregation of results from multiple initial models to address non-uniqueness.
- **Comprehensive Workflow**: Supports both forward computation (dispersion curve generation) and inversion (subsurface structure recovery), validated through numerical simulations (near-surface and crustal LVL models) and real data applications (Mirandola site and USArray).

## Installation

The program can be cloned from the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pan3rock/QEDispInv.git
cd QEDispInv
git submodule update --init
```

Please refer to the [`Install`](doc/INSTALL.md) document for compilation instructions and dependencies.

## Tutorial

A detailed tutorial covering step-by-step instructions for using QEDispInv, including forward
modeling setup, inversion parameter configuration, result visualization, and example walkthroughs,
is available in the [`Tutorial`](doc/TUTORIAL.md) document. This tutorial is designed to help new
users quickly get started with the toolkit and explore its full functionality.

## Usage

QEDispInv provides command-line interfaces for both forward and inversion modules:

- **Forward Modeling**: Compute dispersion curves for a given subsurface model using the quadratic extrema interpolation method.
- **Inversion**: Perform inversion of observed dispersion curves to derive shear-wave velocity profiles, incorporating the wavelength-constrained layering and empirical relationships described in this work.

Detailed usage examples and parameter specifications are available in the [`Tutorial`](doc/TUTORIAL.md).

## Python forward API (experimental)

An experimental Python wrapper is available for directly computing dispersion curves without invoking the command-line tool. Build the shared library target after configuring CMake:

```bash
cmake --build build --target qedispinv_forward
```

The compiled library is placed under `lib/`. You can then call the ctypes helper in `python/forward_api.py`:

```python
import numpy as np
from python.forward_api import compute_dispersion

model = np.loadtxt("demo/syn-nearsurface/model_data.txt")
freqs = np.linspace(0.5, 5.0, 20)
curves = compute_dispersion(model, freqs, mode_max=1)
print(curves)
```
